## About Me

I am a PhD student studying electrical and computer engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.

My primary research interests are in compilers and high performance computing.

## Programming experiance:
I most familiar with C++ and Python.

I've used Golang, Matlab, and Verilog in the past during undergrad, but for at least the last 2 years, I've literally only every touched C++ and Python.

Oh, I guess I know C.

## Other interests:

Outside of coding/technology related things I really love martial arts, music, and weightlifting. 

I've been doing Jiu Jitsu and playing guitar for a while now.

I also have a [personal website](https://a-h-nguyen.github.io/). I have not touched it since 2024 when I started at UT...

I also do not know how to use html or CSS so really the website is just here for us to point and laugh `:)`
