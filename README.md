## About Me

I am an Undergraduate Electrical and Computer Engineer with a minor in Game Design at Northeastern University in Boston, and am part of the class of 2024.
As a freshman back in 2019, I actually attended University of Massachusetts Lowell, but transfered to NEU for my second year onwards.

My primary interests are in Compilers and Operating Systems.

## Programming experiance:
I most familiar with C/C++ and Python.

I also have experience with Golang, Matlab, and Verilog., with a deep love (obsession?) with LaTeX typesetting.
Whenever I use Markdown, there's a deep pining for TeX that erupts in my veins.
I do not have a problem.

## Other interests:
I have made some small games in Unity and Godot, and am planning to make more in the future.
I view games as an artistic endeavor in spirit, and to that end I would love to create music and art for the games I plan on creating eventually
