## About Me

I am a PhD student studying electrical and computer engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.

My primary research interests are in compilers, computer architecture, and high performance computing.

## Programming experiance:
I most familiar with C/C++ and Python.

I also have experience with Golang, Matlab, and Verilog, with a deep love (obsession?) with LaTeX typesetting.
Whenever I use Markdown, there's a deep pining for TeX that erupts in my veins.

I do not have a problem.

## Other interests:
I really love game development, and have made a couple small games in Unity and Godot.
None of them are very remarkable in my opinion, however I had a lot of fun making them.

Outside of coding/technology related things I really love martial arts and music.

If you want to learn more about me feel free to check out my [personal website](https://a-h-nguyen.github.io/), which is *very much* a work in progress.
Also, I am **NOT** a web developer, so it will most defintely leave a lot to be desired, even when it nears "completion".
