~ Hello there! My name is Andrew Nguyen
~ I am an Undergraduate Electrical and Computer Engineer studying at Northeastern University

~ Programming experiance:
I have used C++, C#, MATLAB, Python, and GDScript, and have dabbled in BASH.
I would say that I am most comfortable in Python, MATLAB, and C++.

I also know how to use the Linux/Unix shell, and I have some experience using Vim

~ Other interests:
Outside of my major, I am very interested in game design, and am plannign to pursue it as a minor. 
I have made some small games in Unity and Godot, and am planning to make more in the future.
I view games as an artistic endeavor in spirit, and to that end I would love to create music and art for the games I plan on creating eventually
