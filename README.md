## About Me

I am an Undergraduate Electrical and Computer Engineer with a minor in Game Design.
I am studying at Northeastern University in Boston, class of 2024.
As a freshman back in 2019, I attended University of Massachusetts Lowell, and transfered to NEU for my second year onwards.

## Programming experiance:
I most familiar with C, C++, and Python.

I also have experience with Golang, Matlab, BASH, and Verilog.

I also have a deep love (obsession?) with LaTeX typesetting.

## Other interests:
I have made some small games in Unity and Godot, and am planning to make more in the future.
I view games as an artistic endeavor in spirit, and to that end I would love to create music and art for the games I plan on creating eventually
